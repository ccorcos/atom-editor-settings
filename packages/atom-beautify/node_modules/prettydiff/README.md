---------------------------------------------------------------------

api/dom.js
----------

Please feel free to use prettydiff.com.xhtml file to supplement dom.js.  Otherwise, dom.js requires supplemental assistance to map DOM nodes from an HTML source to the properties of the pd.o object found in dom.js.  dom.js is fault tolerant so most of the nodes mapped by pd.o need not be supported from custom HTML.

To run Pretty Diff using dom.js include the following two script tags and bind the pd.recycle() function to the executing event.  Please refer to prettydiff.com.xhtml for an HTML example and documentation.xhtml for option and execution information.

    <script type="application/javascript" src="prettydiff.js"></script>
    <script type="application/javascript" src="api/dom.js"></script>

Node.js / CommonJS / RequireJS
------------------------------

Node.js support is provided by api/node-local.js.  This file can execute
in the following modes:

  * screen - code input is on the command line and output is to the command line
  * filescreen - code input is in a file and the output is to the command line
  * file - the input and the output reside in files
  * directory - everything in a directory is processed into a specified output directory except ".", "..", and subdirectories

Execute in the context of a NodeJS application:

    var prettydiff = require("prettydiff"),
        args       = {
            source: "asdf",
            diff  : "asdd",
            lang  : "text"
        },
        output     = prettydiff.api(args);

From the command line execute api/node-local.js similar to these
examples:

    >node c:\\prettydiff\\api\\node-local.js source:"c:\mydirectory\myfile.js" readmethod:"file" diff:"c:\myotherfile.js"

    >node c:\\prettydiff\\api\\node-local.js source:"c:\mydirectory\myfile.js" mode:"beautify" readmethod:"file" output:"c:\output\otherfile.js"

WSH
---

Create a WSH script file using XML syntax and with a file extension of
"WSF".  This file must have a tag for each supported argument, must be
capable of reading from a file, and retrieving dependencies.

http://prettydiff.com/api/prettydiff.wsf

Pretty Diff would be executed using the following on CLI:

    cscript prettydiff.wsf
    cscript prettydiff.wsf /source:"myFile.xml" /mode:"beautify"

Execute with vanilla JS
-----------------------

    var args   = {
            source: "asdf",
            diff  : "asdd",
            lang  : "text"
        },
        output = prettydiff(args);

Pre-Inventory:
--------------

  * The component files are provided for access to individual functions
   independent of the Pretty Diff application.  The component code is
   already included in prettydiff.js, so it is not needed in addition to
   prettydiff.js.  The only files not included with prettydiff.js are
   the APIs and the stylesheet - diffview.css.

  * For usage documentation please visit

 The code mentioned above has significantly expanded documentation in
 each of the respective function's external JS file as linked above and
 from the documentation page:
 <http://prettydiff.com/documentation.php>

 The compilation of csspretty, csvbeauty, csvmin, jspretty, jsdifflib,
 markup_beauty, and markupmin in this manner is a result of the
 prettydiff() function contained in prettydiff.js.  The per character
 highlighting is the result of the charcomp() function also contained in
 prettydiff.js. Any use or redistribution of these functions must
 mention the following:

 component, aside from directly using the full files in their entirety,

 prettydiff and its required assets is unlimited without author
