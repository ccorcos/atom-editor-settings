Otherwise, dom.js requires supplemental assistance to map DOM nodes from an HTML source to the properties of the pd.o object found in dom.js.  dom.js is fault tolerant so most of the nodes mapped by pd.o need not be supported from custom HTML.\r\n\r\nTo run Pretty Diff using dom.js include the following two script tags and bind the pd.recycle() function to the executing event.  Please refer to prettydiff.com.xhtml for an HTML example and documentation.xhtml for option and execution information.\r\n\r\n    <script type=\"application/javascript\" src=\"prettydiff.js\"></script>\r\n    <script type=\"application/javascript\" src=\"api/dom.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nNode.js / CommonJS / RequireJS\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nNode.js support is provided by api/node-local.js.  This file can execute\r\nin the following modes:\r\n\r\n  * screen - code input is on the command line and output is to the command line\r\n  * filescreen - code input is in a file and the output is to the command line\r\n  * file - the input and the output reside in files\r\n  * directory - everything in a directory is processed into a specified output directory except \".\", \"..\", and subdirectories\r\n\r\nExecute in the context of a NodeJS application:\r\n\r\n    var prettydiff = require(\"prettydiff\"),\r\n        args       = {\r\n            source: \"asdf\",\r\n            diff  : \"asdd\",\r\n            lang  : \"text\"\r\n        },\r\n        output     = prettydiff.api(args);\r\n\r\nFrom the command line execute api/node-local.js similar to these\r\nexamples:\r\n\r\n    >node c:\\\\prettydiff\\\\api\\\\node-local.js source:\"c:\\mydirectory\\myfile.js\" readmethod:\"file\" diff:\"c:\\myotherfile.js\"\r\n\r\n    >node c:\\\\prettydiff\\\\api\\\\node-local.js source:\"c:\\mydirectory\\myfile.js\" mode:\"beautify\" readmethod:\"file\" output:\"c:\\output\\otherfile.js\"\r\n\r\nWSH\r\n---\r\n\r\nCreate a WSH script file using XML syntax and with a file extension of\r\n\"WSF\".  This file must have a tag for each supported argument, must be\r\ncapable of reading from a file, and retrieving dependencies.\r\n\r\nhttp://prettydiff.com/api/prettydiff.wsf\r\n\r\nPretty Diff would be executed using the following on CLI:\r\n\r\n    cscript prettydiff.wsf\r\n    cscript prettydiff.wsf /source:\"myFile.xml\" /mode:\"beautify\"\r\n\r\nExecute with vanilla JS\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n    var args   = {\r\n            source: \"asdf\",\r\n            diff  : \"asdd\",\r\n            lang  : \"text\"\r\n        },\r\n        output = prettydiff(args);\r\n\r\nPre-Inventory:\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n  * The component files are provided for access to individual functions\r\n   independent of the Pretty Diff application.  The component code is\r\n   already included in prettydiff.js, so it is not needed in addition to\r\n   prettydiff.js.
