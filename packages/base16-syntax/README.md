## Install Base16 Syntax

Base16 Syntax can be installed by going to the _Settings_ view (`cmd-,`). Select the _Themes_ section on the left side and type in `Base16` in the _Search themes..._ search box. Click on the _Install_ button on the Base16 Syntax card.

Alternatively, open a terminal and type in:

```
apm install base16-syntax
```

## Enable Base16 Syntax

Base16 Syntax can be enabled by going to the _Settings_ view (`cmd-,`). Select the _Themes_ section on the left side and choose _Base16_ from the _Syntax Theme_ drop down menu.

## Change the default theme

The `Default (Light)` syntax theme is loaded when using a light UI theme and the `Default (Dark)` syntax theme is loaded when using a dark UI theme or when a dark or light UI theme could not be detected.

The theme can be changed by choosing a different `scheme` or `style` from the drop down menu in the `Base16 Syntax` _Settings_ view.

Alternatively, the theme can be changed in the Preview Mode. Toggle the _Command Palette_ (`ctrl-shift-P`). Type in `Base16 Syntax: Select Theme` and choose another theme from the list. While browsing through the list of available themes a live preview of each selected theme is automatically applied to all open files.

Note: by default, only the styles matching the UI theme are shown in the Preview Mode, i.e. only dark styles are shown when using a dark UI theme and only light styles are shown when using a light UI theme. This can be disabled by going to the _Settings_ view (`cmd-,`). Select the `Base16 Syntax` package section on the left side and uncheck `Match User Interface Theme`.
