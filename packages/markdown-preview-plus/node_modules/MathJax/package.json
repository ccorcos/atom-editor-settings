It was designed with\nthe goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a\nsingle, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers\nand operating systems.  It requires no setup on the part of the user (no\nplugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write\nweb documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be\nable to view it naturally and easily.  Simply include MathJax and some\nmathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.\n\nSome of the main features of MathJax include:\n\n- High-quality display of LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation in HTML pages\n\n- Supported in most browsers with no plug-ins, extra fonts, or special\n  setup for the reader\n\n- Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers\n\n- Supports math accessibility, cut-and-paste interoperability, and other\n  advanced functionality\n\n- Powerful API for integration with other web applications\n\nSee <http://www.mathjax.org/> for additional details.\n\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\nThe MathJax installation and usage documentation is available in the\n`docs/html` directory of the MathJax distribution (see\n`docs/html/index.html` for the starting point).
