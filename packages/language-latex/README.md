# language-latex package

Syntax highlighting for LaTeX in atom. Converted from the
[Textmate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/latex.tmbundle)

# About snippets
Some features (e.g., [placeholder duplication](https://github.com/atom/snippets/issues/17)) are not yet implemented in Atom snippets management. It is for now impossible to reproduce some advanced coding. The majority of snippets have just been converted or simplified, a few are not property usable for now.
